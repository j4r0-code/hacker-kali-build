Creating an Ansible playbook to customize a Kali Linux installation with the specific components you've mentioned involves several steps. Since I can't write the entire playbook here due to its complexity and length, I'll guide you through the structure and key components you should include. This will be a high-level overview, and you will need to fill in the specifics based on your exact configuration needs.

1. Main Playbook Structure (main.yml)
yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Customize Kali Linux
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - kali-desktop-i3
    - i3blocks
    - compton
    - rofi
    - alacritty
    - nerd-fonts
    - oh-my-zsh
    - vscode
    - tmux
2. Roles Directory Structure
Each role should have its own directory under the roles/ directory, with subdirectories for tasks, files, templates, and handlers if necessary.

For example:

markdown
Copy code
roles/
└── kali-desktop-i3/
    ├── tasks/
    ├── files/
    └── templates/
3. Role-Specific Task Examples
kali-desktop-i3 Role
roles/kali-desktop-i3/tasks/main.yml

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Install kali-desktop-i3
  apt:
    name: kali-desktop-i3
    state: latest

- name: Copy i3 configuration file
  copy:
    src: files/i3config
    dest: ~/.config/i3/config
    owner: "{{ ansible_user_id }}"
    mode: '0644'
i3blocks Role
roles/i3blocks/tasks/main.yml

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Install i3blocks
  apt:
    name: i3blocks
    state: latest

- name: Copy i3blocks configuration
  copy:
    src: files/i3blocks.conf
    dest: ~/.config/i3blocks/i3blocks.conf
    owner: "{{ ansible_user_id }}"
    mode: '0644'
Nerd Fonts Role
roles/nerd-fonts/tasks/main.yml

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Download and Install Nerd Fonts
  get_url:
    url: "<font-url>"
    dest: "/usr/local/share/fonts/"
  when: <condition to check if font is not already installed>
4. Variables
Use variables for user-specific or customizable elements. You can define these in group_vars/, host_vars/, or directly within the roles.

5. Templates and Files
For configuration files (like .config for i3 or i3blocks), place them in the files or templates directory of the respective role. Use templates for configurations that require dynamic values.

6. Handlers
If any service needs to be restarted or reloaded after changes, define handlers in the handlers directory of the respective role.

7. Execution
Run the playbook with:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook main.yml
Note:
This playbook assumes you're running it as the local user with sudo privileges.
You need to fill in the actual configurations for i3, i3blocks, Compton, rofi, alacritty, Nerd Fonts, Oh My Zsh, VSCode, and tmux according to your preferences.
You may need to add additional tasks for dependencies or specific configurations.
Test each role independently to make sure it works as expected before integrating it into the main playbook.
This structure gives you a starting point to build a comprehensive Ansible playbook for customizing Kali Linux. You'll need to adapt and expand each role according to your specific needs and preferences.
